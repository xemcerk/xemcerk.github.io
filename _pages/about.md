About Me
---
I am currently a first-year PhD student at the University of Strasbourg, supervised by [Prof. Nicolas Padoy](https://camma.unistra.fr/npadoy/). I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering from NorthEast University (NEU) at Qinhuangdao.

My research interests are centered around Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) and surgical video understanding. I have hands-on experience in natural language processing (NLP), multi-modal systems, and recommender systems. Feel free to reach out via email if youâ€™re interested in collaboration.
