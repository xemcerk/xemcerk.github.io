About Me
---
I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Didi Chuxing. I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering from NorthEast University (NEU) at Qinhuangdao.

My research interests focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Recommender Systems, and Multi-modal Representation Learning, with significant emphasis on exploring the applications and mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs).
